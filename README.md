# AI-powered Integrated Crop Management System

!(precision_farm.png)

## Project Overview
The AI-powered Integrated Crop Management System (ICMS) is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize agricultural practices by integrating artificial intelligence and data analytics into crop management. Our system aims to optimize soil health, nutrient management, and overall farm productivity, leading to more sustainable and efficient farming practices.

## Repository Structure

- **code/**: This directory contains all the scripts and modules used in preprocessing the acquired dataset for detailed analysis.
  
- **dataset/**: Here, you'll find the datasets acquired to be used for training and testing the models. It includes raw and processed data related to soil nutrients, crop yields, and environmental factors.

- **data preprocessing file/**: This file contains details used for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering, which are essential steps before feeding the data into the models.
